This repository contains various utility scripts that I find useful for my development and server environments.

== `ps1.sh` - Custom Bash Prompt Setup

This script sets up a custom, colorful, and informative Bash prompt (`PS1`) designed for engineers. It displays the `username@hostname`, the current directory basename, and the current Git branch (if you're inside a Git repository).

=== Features:

*   *User & Hostname:* `username@hostname` in green.
*   *Current Directory:* Basename of the working directory in blue/cyan.
*   *Git Branch Display:* Shows `(branch-name)` in pink/purple when in a Git repository.
*   *Two-Line Prompt:* Separates information from input for better readability.

=== Deployment (One-Liner)

To quickly apply this custom prompt to your Ubuntu (or compatible Bash) system, you can use the following one-liner. This command will download the `ps1.sh` script and pipe its content directly to `bash` for execution. It will append the `PS1` configuration to your `~/.bashrc` and then `source` it to apply immediately.

[source,bash]
----
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hugo2128/scripts/main/ps1.sh | bash
----

*What the script does:*

. Appends the `export PS1="..."` configuration to your `~/.bashrc` file.
. Sources (`. ~/.bashrc`) your `~/.bashrc` file to apply the new prompt configuration to your current shell session.

=== Manual Installation (Recommended for Review)

For those who prefer to inspect the script before execution (highly recommended for security best practices), you can download it first:

[source,bash]
----
# 1. Download the script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hugo2128/scripts/main/ps1.sh -o ps1.sh

# 2. Review the script's content
less ps1.sh
# Or, if you prefer a graphical editor
# nano ps1.sh
# vi ps1.sh

# 3. Execute the script if satisfied
bash ps1.sh

# 4. (Optional) Clean up the downloaded file
rm ps1.sh
----

=== Preview

Once installed, your prompt will look something like this:

_Note: Replace with an actual screenshot of your prompt for best results._
